Ideas for improvement:
- Answers in list
- add functions
- f-string formatting
- Add more ascii art
- Import time and add theatrical pauses

'''
The following is the solution to the codecademy exercise. Remember name and question are not obtained by
user input and this is how we deal with empty strings there:

if not question:
    print('The Magic 8-Ball cannot provide a fortune unless you ask it something.')
elif not name:
    print('Question: ' + question)
    print('Magic 8-Ball\'s answer: ' + answer)
else:
    print(name + ' asks: ' + question)
    # Magic 8-Ball’s answer: [Answer]
    print('Magic 8-Ball\'s answer: ' + answer)
