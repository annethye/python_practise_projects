# Learn Python 3
This repository contains my solutions to the practise projects provided in the 3 python courses on codecademy: Learn python 3, Learn intermediate python 3 and learn advanced python 3

## Projects
### Hello World
#### [Block Letters](block_letters.py) - ASCII art
> 

- Ascii Art

#### [Receipts for Lovely Loveseats](receipts_for_lovely_loveseats.py) 
> Generating itemised customer receipts for the furniture store Lovely Loveseats by tracking purchases, applying sales tax, and formatting totals using basic variables, strings, arithmetic operations

### Control Flow
#### [Magic 8-Ball](magic_8_ball.py) 
- control flow, ascii art, random module

#### [Sal's Shipping](sals_shipping.py)
or Sal’s Shippers that calculates the cheapest shipping method based on package weight, comparing ground, premium, and drone options to give customers the best deal.

### Lists
#### [Gradebook](gradebook.py)
> A project that uses nested Python lists to manage, update, and combine subject–grade records across multiple semesters, including support for both numerical and pass/fail grading.

#### [Len's Slice](lens_slice.py)
> A project that uses list operations to organise, sort, and analyse pizza sales data at Len’s Slice, including identifying the cheapest and most expensive items and extracting price-based subsets.

### Loops
#### [Carly's Clippers](carlys_clippers.py)
This project uses Python to analyze data for a hair salon. You work with lists representing hairstyles, prices, and sales from the past week. The script calculates metrics such as average haircut price, total and average daily revenue, and identifies affordable haircuts. The project helps practice using loops, list comprehensions, and basic data analysis techniques.


### Functions
#### [Getting Ready for Physics Class](getting_ready_for_physics_class.py)
> A project that defines reusable functions to calculate temperature conversions, force, energy, and work, providing simple computational tools for teaching core physics concepts.

### Strings
#### [Thread Shed](thread_shed.py)
> A project that cleans and parses Thread Shed's raw daily sales string into structured transaction lists, calculates total revenue, and counts thread colours sold across all purchases.

#### [Coded Correspondence](coded_correspondence.ipynb)
> A project that implements and tests the classic substitution ciphers Caesar and Vigenère with encode and decode functions, that preserve punctuation while shifting letters, using known offsets and keywords to decrypt Vishal's messages and generate encrypted replies.

### Modules
#### [Time Traveller's Toolkit](time_travellers_toolkit.py) 
This project guides you through building a Python script that simulates time travel. You create and use a custom module, work with dates and times, perform precise cost calculations, randomly select years and destinations, and generate a personalized time travel message. The project helps practice importing modules, using built-in functions, and formatting output.


### Dictionaries
#### [Scrabble](scrabble.py)
> A project that uses dictionaries to score Scrabble words, track players and their played words, and maintain up-to-date point totals as a game progresses.

#### [Abruptly Goblins](abruptly_goblins.ipynb)
> A project that organises and analyses player availability for the Sorcery Society's tabletop RPG Abruptly Goblins nights, using structured gamer records to count attendance per weekday, automatically select the optimal and fallback game nights with the highest turnout, and generate personalised email invitations for all players able to attend each session.

### Files
#### [Hacking the Fender](hacking_the_fender.py)
> A program to identify compromised passwords from a CSV file, write them to a text file, notify a supervisor with a JSON message, and overwrite the original password file with a hacker's signature. The project demonstrates file input/output, data parsing, and the use of standard modules for handling CSV and JSON data.

### Classes
#### [Basta Fazoolin](basta_fazoolin.py)
> A project that organises a growing restaurant business by modelling Basta Fazoolin’ with My Heart and Take a’ Arepa using classes for businesses, franchises, and time-based menus, enabling menu availability checks by time, bill calculation from item selections, and reuse of shared menus across multiple locations.
