# Learn Python 3
This repository contains my solutions to the practise projects provided in the 3 python courses on codecademy: Learn python 3, Learn intermediate python 3 and learn advanced python 3


## Projects

### Hello World
[Block Letters](block_letters.py)         -  Ascii Art

[Receipts for Lovely Loveseats](receipts_for_lovely_loveseats.py)  -  Receipt system for the furniture store Lovely Loveseats
- strings and numbers to create and update variables. We were able to print out an itemized list and a total cost for our customer. Lovely!

### Control Flow
[Magic 8-Ball](magic_8_ball.py) control flow, ascii art, random module

[Sal's Shipping](sals_shipping.py)
or Sal’s Shippers that calculates the cheapest shipping method based on package weight, comparing ground, premium, and drone options to give customers the best deal.

### Lists
[Gradebook](gradebook.py)

[Len's Slice](lens_slice.py)

### Loops
[Carly's Clippers](carlys_clippers.py)
This project uses Python to analyze data for a hair salon. You work with lists representing hairstyles, prices, and sales from the past week. The script calculates metrics such as average haircut price, total and average daily revenue, and identifies affordable haircuts. The project helps practice using loops, list comprehensions, and basic data analysis techniques.


### Functions
[Getting Ready for Physics Class](getting_ready_for_physics_class.py)
This project is a Python exercise where you create functions to help with basic physics calculations. You write functions to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius, calculate force, energy, and work, and use these functions with example values. The project helps practice defining functions, using parameters, and applying math formulas in code.


### Strings
[Thread Shed](thread_shed.py)

[Coded Correspondence](coded_correspondence.py)

### Modules
[Time Traveller's Toolkit](time_travellers_toolkit.py)
This project guides you through building a Python script that simulates time travel. You create and use a custom module, work with dates and times, perform precise cost calculations, randomly select years and destinations, and generate a personalized time travel message. The project helps practice importing modules, using built-in functions, and formatting output.


### Dictionaries
[Scrabble](scrabble.py)

[Abruptly Goblins](abruptly_goblins.py)
### Files
[Hacking the Fender](hacking_the_fender.py)
a Python program is created to identify compromised usernames from a CSV file, write them to a text file, notify a supervisor with a JSON message, and overwrite the original password file with a hacker’s signature. The project demonstrates file input/output, data parsing, and the use of standard Python modules for handling CSV and JSON data.

OTHER PRJECTS: THIS IS DONE BUT NOT ON GITHUB!
frida kahlo:
The Frida Kahlo cumulative project asks you to use Python lists to organize paintings, their dates, and assign each a unique audio tour ID. You combine painting titles and dates, add new paintings, count the total, create ID numbers, and zip everything into a master list for the museum’s audio tour. This helps practice list operations and pairing data in Python.

Boredless tourist
This project, The Boredless Tourist, is a Python-based recommendation engine. It helps travelers find attractions in different cities that match their interests. The program uses lists to store destinations, attractions, and traveler data. It matches traveler interests with attraction tags and generates a personalized message suggesting places to visit. The project also practices using functions, lists, and basic data handling in Python.
